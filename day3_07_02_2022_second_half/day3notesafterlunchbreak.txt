Iterations:-
   1) Initialisation of the counter variable.
       int ctr=0;
   2) ctr<10  ( condition check decides whether the execution will enter the loop or not in the first step and in latter steps it decides whether
to remain within the loop or go out of the loop)
According to the lines above ctr is intialised with 0 and
in the condition 0 is compared with value 10 and it less 10.
So condition is true. As the condition is true it enters the loop.
Now consider a case where we are writing ctr=11 intially so
in that case the condition check step becomes false and it wont enter
the loop.
3) Re-intialisation of the loop. Which means we need to change the
value of the ctr which will decide whether the control should be
continued within the loop or control should move out of the loop.
------------------------------------------------------------------
* for     (entry point check)

* while  ( entry point check)
While entering or at the begining of the loop condition check is 
being made in that case if the intial condition is false , the
control wont enter the loop.

* do while ( exit point check) So in case of do while if the
initial condition is false the loop will execute atleast once
and at the end as the condition is checked and evaluates as false, 
the control goes out of the loop.

----------------------------------
In for loop / while loop
1) intialisation step and condition check works once.
2) After that it is the reinitialisation step and the condition check.
